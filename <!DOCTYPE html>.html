		<p>When the function is called, you want to pass information about the event to it (providing context
about the event). Thus, you place event between brackets to indicate it will be passed as a param-
eter to the function. The event object will be created and populated by the browser itself; your code
simply needs to pass it on.
In this lesson, you will embed JavaScript directly in the head section of the web page. JavaScript can
be added by simply including it within a script element. Therefore, add the following just below
the end of the style element.
